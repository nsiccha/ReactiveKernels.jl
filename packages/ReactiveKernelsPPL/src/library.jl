# Shipped @rkppl library submodels: ordinary submodels written in the
# surface language with every default prior stated in the body, so a
# program reads (and rewrites) exactly what the use site expands to. A use
# site `y ~ sm(...)` / `z ~ sm(...)` resolves here through the exported
# binding (the caller's module sees it via `using ReactiveKernelsPPL`) and
# lowers to the identical plan as the hand-inlined body (see
# [`RKPPLSubmodel`](@ref)): body names namespace under the use-site
# left-hand side.

    y ~ ordered_logistic(eta)

Shipped observation-stream submodel for a cumulative-logit ordinal response
(levels `1..K`). Its body states the default cutpoint prior and observes the
response:

```julia
@rkppl ordered_logistic(eta) = begin
    cutpoints ~ Ordered(Normal(0, 1), length(levels(y)) - 1)
    y .~ OrderedLogistic.(eta, Ref(cutpoints))
    return y
end
```

At `y ~ ordered_logistic(eta)` the cutpoints are `y_cutpoints`; the plan is
the hand-written two statements above with `y_cutpoints`. To use a different
prior, write those statements yourself.

@rkppl ordered_logistic(eta) = begin
    cutpoints ~ Ordered(Normal(0, 1), length(levels(y)) - 1)
    y .~ OrderedLogistic.(eta, Ref(cutpoints))
    return y
end
