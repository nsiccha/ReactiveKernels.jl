# Changelog

All notable changes to ReactiveKernels.jl are documented here, newest first.
The nested packages under `packages/` keep their own versions and changelogs.

Every landing that adds or changes public API (an export, a macro, a keyword,
a method, or documented behaviour a dependant can rely on) bumps the patch
digit in `Project.toml` and adds its entry under a new heading at the top of
this file. An entry that breaks something a dependant relies on says
**Breaking:** and what to change. The minor digit, the breaking one in
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) before 1.0, has not moved yet.
A package or app that calls that API states the version as its floor, for
example `[compat] ReactiveKernels = "0.1.2"`. An environment that pins an
older ReactiveKernels commit is then refused when it resolves, with
`Unsatisfiable requirements detected for package ReactiveKernels`, instead of
failing or silently behaving differently at run time. Changes before 0.1.2
are recorded in the git history only.

## 0.1.4

- A per-row value that native lowering keeps as its arithmetic (a dotted
  broadcast or an `hcat` read only by indexing, such as
  `sigma = exp.(s0 .+ s1 .* x)`), indexed by an integer vector, a range, a
  colon or a mask, computes only the entries it selects. A group cell
  gathering its rows, `sigma[rows[g]]`, therefore computes those rows; it
  computed the whole value at every read, once per group, so a density cost
  a full pass over the rows per group (300 groups of 10 rows: 2.0 ms and
  7.3 MB per call, now 40 µs and 110 KB, beside 37 µs and 91 KB for the
  same rows gathered from a stored vector). Values are unchanged. Where the
  value combined a sampled scalar with a data column, ordinary Enzyme
  Reverse (registered 0.13.216) also refused the gradient with
  `EnzymeRuntimeActivityError`; it now differentiates it.

## 0.1.3

- Preparation checks the code of the prepared program, not only the types of
  its values. `type_stability_level` sets how far: `:values` infers the type of
  every value, as 0.1.2 did; `:rk` also audits the body ReactiveKernels
  generates and the functions of its packages, with every other function a
  leaf whose call must dispatch statically and return a concrete type; `:all`,
  the new default, also audits every function that code calls, a client
  helper's body included, except Julia's own Base, Core and standard libraries.
  A finding names its method and each non-concrete value or call dispatched at
  run time. A helper that dispatches at run time but asserts its result
  (`f(x) = (g(x))::Float64`) now warns, and so does a declared local
  (`mu::Vector{Float64} = f(x)`) over a helper whose result is not inferred.
  `prepare_ad*` audit the callable their backend differentiates.
- Preparation can refuse a type instability instead of warning once per
  process. With `type_stability = :error`, `prepare`, `prepare!` and every
  `prepare_ad*` throw a `TypeInstabilityError` whose `messages` name every
  finding, at every preparation. The default stays `:warn`.
- Both settings are keywords and ReactiveKernels preferences of the same name.
  A project sets them for every preparation it makes, including those that
  packages such as ReactiveKernelsPPL make for it, for example with
  `Preferences.set_preferences!(ReactiveKernels, "type_stability" => "error")`
  (`[ReactiveKernels] type_stability = "error"` in its `LocalPreferences.toml`,
  which `Pkg.test` carries into the test environment). The preferences are read
  at the first preparation of a Julia session; a new session picks up a change
  without recompiling anything. A call's keywords take precedence for that call
  and the preparations nested in it. Cached preparations are kept per setting,
  so a kernel prepared under `:warn` or a lower level is never returned to a
  stricter call. `Preferences` is a new dependency; `PrecompileTools` already
  loaded it.
- The typed-IR audit that held RK's own lowering to type-stable programs in the
  test suite (`test/type_stability_audit.jl`) moved to
  `src/type_stability_audit.jl`; the RK and RKPPL gates use it from there.

## 0.1.2

- A summed plate whose cells hold arrays adds them elementwise, as Julia's
  `sum` does: with `cells = plate(groups) do xs; b .* xs; end`,
  `total = sum(cells)` is `b .* sum(groups)`, and a cell `[b * u, b * v]` or
  a matrix cell `xs * xs'` sums the same way, also when the plate consumes a
  scan or runs by index runs. The fused total starts from the first cell; it
  was seeded with `zero(T)` for the cell type, which raised
  `MethodError: no method matching zero(::Type{Vector{Float64}})` before any
  cell ran. Cells of different lengths raise Julia's `DimensionMismatch`, and
  an empty plate fails as `sum(Vector{Float64}[])` does. Numeric cells keep
  their `zero(T)` start. Native values and ordinary Enzyme Reverse gradients.
